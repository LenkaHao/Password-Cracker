/*
In the node.js intro tutorial (http://nodejs.org/), they show a basic tcp
server, but for some reason omit a client connecting to it.  I added an
example at the bottom.
Save the following server in example.js:
*/

var net = require('net');

var server = net.createServer();

server.listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');

// When a client requests a connection with the server, the server creates a new
// socket dedicated to that client.
server.on('connection', function(socket) {
    console.log('A new connection has been established.');

    // Now that a TCP connection has been established, the server can send data to
    // the client by writing to its socket.
    // socket.write('Hello, client.');

    // The server can also receive data from the client by reading from its socket.
    socket.on('data', function(chunk) {
        console.log("Data received from client: "+chunk.toString());
				socket.write("55555");
    });

    // When the client requests to end the TCP connection with the server, the server
    // ends the connection.
    socket.on('end', function() {
        console.log('Closing connection with the client');
    });

    // Don't forget to catch error, for your own sake.
    socket.on('error', function(err) {
        console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
    });
});
